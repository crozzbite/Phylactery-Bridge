# 🌉 Phylactery Bridge: Business & Strategic Plan
> **Status:** SaaS Product (Commercial)
> **Engine:** Powered by Phylactery Core (Python)
> **BFF:** Node.js (NestJS) — Auth, Payments, Usage
> **Version:** 2.0 (Hybrid BFF Architecture)

## 1. Executive Summary
**Phylactery Bridge** is a "SaaS for Developers" that acts as an intelligent intermediary between the coder and their AI models. Instead of mere chat, it orchestrates a structured **Deliberation Process** (Architect → Auditor → Writer) to produce high-quality, secure, and context-aware code.

**Architecture**: 3-layer Hybrid BFF.
- **Angular Frontend** — UX and real-time rendering
- **NestJS BFF** — Business logic (auth, payments, usage tracking, job queue)
- **Python Engine** — AI orchestration (LangGraph, Pinecone RAG, MCP tools)

## 2. Value Proposition (The Painkiller)
*   **For Senior Devs:** "Stop copy-pasting context. Bridge keeps your Architecture, Security, and Code Generation in sync."
*   **For Solopreneurs:** "Your on-demand CTO and Security Auditor. Don't build technical debt."
*   **The Hook:** "Audited AI Code." (Not just *generated* code).

## 3. Business Model
*   **Type:** B2Prosumer SaaS (Subscription).
*   **Pricing Strategy:**
    *   **Free (Trial):** 5 Deliberations/mo. (Hook)
    *   **Plus ($29/mo):** 80 Deliberations. (Solopreneur)
    *   **Pro ($59/mo):** 300 Deliberations + Team Sharing. (Small Teams)
*   **Unit Economics:** High margin (>60%) due to efficient token usage via Phylactery's optimized system prompts.

## 4. Go-to-Market Strategy
*   **Launchpad:** Product Hunt + Hacker News.
*   **Growth Loop:** "Share your Deliberation". Users share public links of how Bridge debated a complex architecture decision.
*   **Content:** "Refactoring Famous Repos". Blog series where Bridge audits and refactors popular open-source libraries.

## 5. Financial Goals (Year 1)
*   **Q1:** Build MVP (Angular Frontend + NestJS BFF + Phylactery Engine connection). 0 Rev.
*   **Q2:** Beta Launch (50 users). ~$1,500 MRR.
*   **Q3:** Public Launch. ~$4,000 MRR.
*   **Q4:** Scale & Features. ~$8,000 MRR (Break-even + Founder Salary).
