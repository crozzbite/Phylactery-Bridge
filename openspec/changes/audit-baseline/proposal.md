# Audit Baseline Proposal

## Objective
Establish a baseline architecture specification for `Phylactery-Bridge` by reverse-engineering the current codebase.

## Scope
- **Backend**: FastAPI structure, Auth, Database models.
- **Frontend**: Angular 19 implementation, adherence to SkullRender standards.
- **Security**: Gap analysis against OWASP standards.

## Deliverables
- `specs/backend.yaml`: Current backend API and architecture.
- `specs/frontend.yaml`: Current frontend state.
- `audit-report.md`: List of deviations from SkullRender standards.
